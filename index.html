					The  aim  of  this  project  is  to  identify  the  gender  of a  speaker  based  on  the  voice  of  the  speaker  using Linear Prediction Features. Gender-based differences in human speech are partly due to physiological differences such as vocal fold thickness or vocal tract length and partly due to differences in speaking style.
					Since these changes are reflected in the speech signal, we hope to exploit these properties to automatically classify a speaker as male or female. The gender classification is done by using Support Vector Machines (SVM).

						What do male and female speech sound different? Gender-based differences in human speech are partly due to physiological differences such as vocal fold thickness or vocal tract length and partly due to differences in speaking style.
Adult men and women typically have different sizes of vocal fold; reflecting the male-female differences in larynx size. The male vocal folds are between 17 mm and 25 mm in length. The female vocal folds are between 12.5 mm and 17.5 mm in length. The difference in vocal folds size between men and women means that they have differently pitched voices. Generally, women have higher pitch than men do.
The fundamental frequency/pitch of male voice lies in the range of 85 to 180 Hz while that of the female in the range of 150 to 300 Hz. This discrimination qualifies pitch as an effective feature for gender.
However, there is some overlap for the pitches of high-pitch males and low-pitch females. For increasing classification accuracy, combining pitch and other speech feature is necessary (discussed later).
 
A second important physiological difference is vocal tract length, that is, the distance from the vocal folds to the lips.  All  things  being  equal,  the  longer  the  vocal  tract,  the  lower  the resonant frequencies. The  average  length  of  the  adult  female  vocal  tract is about 14.5  cm,  while  the average  male  vocal tract  is  17  to 18  cm long.
Men, generally speaking, have a larger vocal tract, which essentially gives the resultant voice a lower-sounding timbre.
The vocal tract act as the resonator of the voice. The human vocal tract resonates in different frequency.
Usually it shows four or more resonances. The Formant is the term applied to describe the resonant frequencies of the voice tract. In terms of the Formants, about five formants are required for male voice while four formats for female voice. The formant frequencies of female are higher than that of the male. The difference is very high in the third and fourth formants and least for the first formant. This is mainly due to the length of the voice tract.
Our approach is to extract features that help us distinguish the gender of a given human voice using the physiological differences in the two genders.
Gender-based differences in human speech are partly due to physiological differences such as vocal fold thickness or vocal tract length and partly due to differences in speaking style. We are going to exploit the physiological differences to distinguish between the two genders.
